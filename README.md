# Valiance Solutions Temperature API

NOTE: This document is best viewed in Markdown format

This is the solution to the assignment provided by Valiance Solutions. The assignment instructs to create Django models and build a REST API using them.

The API revolves around the recording of temperatures of employees in a company. It contains three models:

- Device (Temperature Reading Device)
- Temperature (Body Temperature Reading)
- Employee

It follows the relation Device -&gt; Temperature -&gt; Employee

## Setting up the projects

Kindly follow the following steps to set up the project and run the server:

- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the server: `python manage.py runserver.py`
- The server will be running on 'http://localhost:8000/'.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available:

### Project index and admin

- ### Welcome Page : `GET /`

  The welcome page of the REST API server.

  ```
